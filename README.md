Collections of script I wrote for Foundry's Mari texturing software.

## Utilisation

Everything should be written in the top docstring of each script.
Else a README.md should be supplied.

## What's Inside

- Nodegraph
    - `mari_create_new_channels.py` : Quickly create multiple channels.
    - `mari_group_expose.py`: From a selection of same node type expose all of their attribute under
    the parent GroupNode and linked them.
    - `mari_paint_replace.py` : Create new paint node that is an exact
     copy of the current one, except it's blank, and delete the original one.
